### OpenCV
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms.
OpenCV's application areas include:
  - Facial recognition system<br>
  A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces. Researchers are currently developing multiple methods in which facial recognition systems work.
  - Gesture recognition<br>
  Gesture recognition is a type of perceptual computing user interface that allows computers to capture and interpret human gestures as commands. The general definition of gesture recognition is the ability of a computer to understand gestures and execute commands based on those gestures.
  - Human–computer interaction (HCI)<br>
  Human–computer interaction studies the design and use of computer technology, focused on the interfaces between people and computers. Researchers in the field of HCI observe the ways in which humans interact with computers and design technologies that let humans interact with computers in novel ways.
  - Mobile robotics<br>
  Mobile robots have the capability to move around in their environment and are not fixed to one physical location. Mobile robots can be "autonomous" (AMR - autonomous mobile robot) which means they are capable of navigating an uncontrolled environment without the need for physical or electro-mechanical guidance devices
  - Object identification<br>
  Image classification involves predicting the class of one object in an image. Object localization refers to identifying the location of one or more objects in an image and drawing abounding box around their extent. Object detection combines these two tasks and localizes and classifies one or more objects in an image.
  

### Contours
Contours can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous points (along the boundary), having same color or intensity. The contours are a useful tool for shape analysis and object detection and recognition.

### Dilation
Dilation is one of the two basic operators in the area of mathematical morphology, the other being erosion. It is typically applied to binary images, but there are versions that work on grayscale images. The basic effect of the operator on a binary image is to gradually enlarge the boundaries of regions of foreground pixels (i.e. white pixels, typically). Thus areas of foreground pixels grow in size while holes within those regions become smaller.

### Erosion
Erosion is the second morphological operator. It is also applied to binary images. The basic effect of the operator on a binary image is to erode away the boundaries of regions of foreground pixels (i.e. white pixels, typically). Thus areas of foreground pixels shrink in size, and holes within those areas become larger.


### Perfect Mazes
Perfect mazes have a characteristic that there is only one possible path from start to end. This means that this image can be divided into two parts and this boundary of division will be the solution itself. Therefore, morphological transformations like erosion and dilation are just enough to find the solution of the maze.
